        // in StructureTutorialMain.addDimensionalSpacing and then create a superflat world, exit it,
        // and re-enter it and your structures will be spawning. I could not figure out why it needs
        // the restart but honestly, superflat is really buggy and shouldn't be your main focus in my opinion.
